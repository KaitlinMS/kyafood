## Server Setup

You'll first want to make sure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) set up on your computer.

Next, run `npm install` to set up all the dependencies.

You can then run `npm start` to start the server, and visit `http://localhost:8000/` in your browser.

The current example data can be seen at `http://localhost:8000/cat/Hopper`.

This project is using nodemon, so you can make changes to the files while the server is running, and they'll be available as soon as you refresh the page.
